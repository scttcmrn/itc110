Chapter 2 questions


1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

True and False. 


2. What are the three Boolean operators?

and
or
not


3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator.

and:
  Expression      |      Evaluates to
True and True     |                True
True and False    |               False
False and True    |               False
False and False   |               False

or:
  Expression      |      Evaluates to
True or True      |                True
True or False     |                True
False or True     |                True
False or False    |               False

not:
Expression        |      Evaluates to
not True          |               False
not False         |                True


4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                  => False
not (5 > 4)                           => False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                   => True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))             => False
(True and True) and (True == False)   => False
(not False) or (not True)             => True


5. What are the six comparison operators?

==
!=
<
>
<=
>=


6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

The equal to (==) operator compares two values. The assignment (=) operator assigns a value to a variable.


7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

A condition is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (True or False). Conditions are used in flow control statements.


8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')               First block starts here
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')          Second block starts here
    else:
        print('ham')            Third block starts here
    print('spam')
print('spam')


9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')


10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

Ctrl + C


11. What is the difference between break and continue?

A break statement will exit a loop's clause, thus ending the loop. A continue statement will restart the loop and reevaluate the loop's condition.


12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

range(10) repeats the loop 10 times.
range(0, 10) 


13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for loop:

for i in range(1,11):
    print(str(i))

while loop:

i = 1
while i < 11:
    print(str(i))
    i = i + 1


14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

spam.bacon()
