1. What is []?

[] represents an empty list. Lists are written inside square brackets.


2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)

spam[2] = 'hello'


For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
3. What does spam[int('3' * 2) / 11] evaluate to? 

'd'

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to? 

'd'

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?

['a', 'b']


For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list  [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]. 
6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?

1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]


9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication? 

+
*


10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

append() attaches values to the end of a list.
insert() can add values anywhere in a list.


11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?

del
remove()


12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values. 

They may both be used with len().
They may both be concatenated and replicated.
They may both be used in for loops.


13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

Lists are typed with brackets and are mutable.
Tuples are typed with parentheses and are immutable; they cannot have their values modified, appended, or removed.


14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it? 

(42,)


15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?

tuple() for lists.
list() for tuples.


16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?

They contain list references.


17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

copy.copy() makes a duplicate copy of a list, instead of copying only a reference to the list.
copy.deepcopy() is used to copy lists that contain other lists.
